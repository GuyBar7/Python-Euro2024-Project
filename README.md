# Euro 2024 Player Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of player statistics from the Euro 2024 tournament. It was completed as a final project for a Data Analyst course at John Bryce College.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of player data from the Euro 2024 tournament. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as player performance, market value, player attributes, and positional data. Through this project, we aim to uncover insights about player characteristics, team compositions, and overall trends within the tournament.
